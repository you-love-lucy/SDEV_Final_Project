New Reservations:
To add a new reservation in the "New Reservation" window, first fill out the guest information under Last Name, First Name, and Address.
Next, enter the Phone Number for the guest. Choose the Payment Type for the guest, and then assign a room.
Add the check-in date. Enter the amount of nights and the rate for the reservation, and then click "Get Price" to calculate the price.
To save the reservation to the Reservation Log file, hit save. The record will be saved in a text file called "reservationRecordLogs.txt" for reference.

Folio:
To add payments and calculate the new balance, hit "Open Folio" and the folio will open.
The price should have carried over from the Reservation window. To add a payment, enter it in the input box and then hit "Add payment"  to add it.
The payment should be added to the text area and subtracted from the remaining balance.

Errors:
"Error in entered data":
This means that the wrong type of data was entered into an input field. Check your data to make sure all fields that should be numerical are so.

"Payment exceeds current balance": 
The payment you entered is greater than the remaining balance. The error window will show the maximum payment.
